# Supply Chain Management System

The **Supply Chain Management System** is a Java Spring Boot backend application designed to manage and streamline business operations involving customers, suppliers, products, and orders. It exposes RESTful APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) records, and supports data persistence using a MySQL database.

This system can be used by businesses to manage their inventory, track orders using tracking numbers, associate products with suppliers, and handle customer-related order data.

## üöÄ Features

- **Customer Management**: Add, view, update, and delete customer information.
- **Order Management**: Create orders linked to customers, fetch by ID, track by tracking number, and manage orders.
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products and fetch by supplier ID.
- **Supplier Management**: Manage supplier data and connect them with products.
- Consistent API responses via a custom `ResponseStructure<T>`.
- Built using a layered architecture: `Controller`, `Service`, `Repository`, `Entity`, `DTO`, and `DAO`.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   bash:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/supply-chain-management-system.git
   cd supply-chain-management-system
2.**Configure the MySQL Database**
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/supply_chain_db
  spring.datasource.username=root
  spring.datasource.password=user
  spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
  spring.jpa.show-sql=true
3.**Test with Postman** (JSON Input/Output)
  All endpoints expect and return JSON. Below are key examples you can test:

    ‚ûï Create Customer
    POST /customer
    Request Body:
   {
  "name": "Rohit Sharma",
  "email": "hitman@gmail.com",
  "address": "Mumbai"
  }

  üîç Track Order by Tracking Number
  GET /orders/tracking/{trackingNumber}
  Example:
  GET /orders/tracking/ABC123456
  
  üì¶ Get Products by Supplier ID
  GET /product/supplier/{supplierId}
  Example:GET /product/supplier/2
  
  ‚ùå Delete Supplier
  DELETE /supplier
  This deletes all supplier records. Customize in your service if you want to delete by ID.
